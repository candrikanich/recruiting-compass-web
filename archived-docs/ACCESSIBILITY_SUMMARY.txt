WCAG 2.1 AA ACCESSIBILITY AUDIT - COACH DETAIL PAGE
=====================================================

OVERALL COMPLIANCE: ~75% (estimated)
STATUS: Multiple critical and high-priority issues found

FINDINGS BY SEVERITY:
=====================

CRITICAL ISSUES (3) - WCAG 2.1 Level A violations
1. Communication Panel Modal - No focus trap, missing ARIA
2. EditCoachModal - No focus trap, close button unlabeled
3. DeleteConfirmationModal - dialog element not used properly

HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (5) - WCAG 2.1 Level AA violations
4. Color-only status indicators (red/orange/green without text)
5. Interaction list lacks semantic structure and keyboard support
6. Save button state changes not announced to screen readers
7. Communication buttons missing aria-haspopup and clear labels
8. Close buttons (×) have no accessible names

MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (6) - Reduced usability
9. Button text clarity ("Edit" vs "Edit Coach")
10. Link focus styling missing on "Back to Coaches"
11. Form fields missing aria-invalid attribute
12. Skip link needs testing
13. Loading/error states need aria-live regions
14. Touch target sizing needs verification at 200% zoom

LOW PRIORITY ISSUES (4) - Minor enhancements
15. Heading hierarchy verification
16. Sentiment badge patterns (color + pattern)

COMPLIANT ELEMENTS (7):
- Skip link implementation
- Form label associations
- Field error handling
- DeleteConfirmationModal native dialog (partially)
- Stats section semantic structure
- Focus ring utilities
- Icon accessibility patterns

IMPACT ANALYSIS:
================

Who is affected:
- Keyboard-only users (no mouse)
- Screen reader users (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Color-blind users (15-20% of male population)
- Users with motor disabilities
- Users with cognitive disabilities

Real-world impact:
- Modals are inaccessible to keyboard users
- Screen readers cannot announce button purposes
- 15-20% of users cannot distinguish status by color alone
- Dynamic updates are invisible to assistive technology
- Navigation flows are broken for keyboard-only users

EFFORT ESTIMATION:
==================

Critical fixes: 2-3 days
High priority fixes: 2-3 days
Medium priority fixes: 1-2 days
Total: ~5-8 days to reach 90%+ compliance

ROI: Significant - affects 15-20% of potential user base

QUICK START:
============

Priority 1 (Today):
1. Add focus trap to Communication Panel Modal
2. Add focus trap to EditCoachModal
3. Fix DeleteConfirmationModal .showModal()

Priority 2 (This week):
4. Add text labels to status indicators
5. Fix close button labels (×)
6. Add aria-live to save feedback

Priority 3 (Next sprint):
7. Convert interaction list to semantic <ul>/<li>
8. Add aria-haspopup to modal trigger buttons
9. Add aria-invalid to form fields

FILES TO MODIFY:
================

Critical:
- /pages/coaches/[id].vue
- /components/EditCoachModal.vue
- /components/DeleteConfirmationModal.vue

High Impact:
- /components/CommunicationPanel.vue
- /components/Coach/CoachStatsGrid.vue
- /components/Coach/CoachHeader.vue
- /components/Coach/CoachNotesEditor.vue
- /components/Coach/CoachRecentInteractions.vue

Medium Impact:
- /components/Coach/CoachForm.vue

TESTING CHECKLIST:
==================

Keyboard Navigation:
- [ ] All interactive elements Tab-accessible
- [ ] Focus order logical
- [ ] Escape closes modals
- [ ] No unintended focus traps

Screen Reader:
- [ ] Modal titles announced
- [ ] All buttons have accessible names
- [ ] Status indicators have text labels
- [ ] Save/error messages announced
- [ ] Error fields identified

Visual:
- [ ] Focus rings visible (3:1 contrast)
- [ ] Touch targets 44x44px minimum
- [ ] Color + text for all status info
- [ ] High zoom (200%) functional

Mobile:
- [ ] Works without zoom
- [ ] Touch targets don't overlap
- [ ] Readable at 16px text minimum

QUICK REFERENCE:
================

CRITICAL FIXES:
- Modal: Add role="dialog" + aria-modal="true" + aria-labelledby
- Modal: Implement focus trap to keep Tab within modal
- Close buttons: Add aria-label="Close [context]"
- DeleteConfirmationModal: Call .showModal() in JavaScript

HIGH PRIORITY FIXES:
- Status numbers: Add text badge (e.g., "Urgent", "Just contacted")
- Interaction list: Use <ul>/<li> instead of <div>
- Save button: Add aria-busy + aria-live region for feedback
- Communication buttons: Add aria-haspopup="dialog"

MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES:
- Form fields: Add aria-invalid when error exists
- Links: Add focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 styling
- Loading states: Add role="status" aria-live="polite"

NEXT STEPS:
===========

1. Read ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT.md for full context
2. Review ACCESSIBILITY_FIX_EXAMPLES.md for code patterns
3. Start with Critical issues (modals)
4. Test each fix with keyboard + screen reader
5. Iterate through High → Medium → Low priorities
6. Run final WCAG compliance check

Expected outcome: 90%+ WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
Time to implement: 3-5 days
