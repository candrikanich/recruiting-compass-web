Hi [First Name],

One of the most powerful features of Recruiting Compass is your Timeline—your personal recruiting roadmap.

**Here's what it looks like:**

Your recruiting journey is organized into 4 phases:

📱 **Freshman** (9th Grade)
Focus: Build skills, get on coaches' radars
Example tasks: Skill development, attend local showcases

📱 **Sophomore** (10th Grade)
Focus: Active outreach, tournament attendance
Example tasks: Send coach introduction emails, attend summer showcases

📱 **Junior** (11th Grade)
Focus: Peak recruiting period
Example tasks: Campus visits, build relationships with top coaches

📱 **Senior** (12th Grade)
Focus: Make your decision
Example tasks: Official visits, narrow your top 5, commit to a school

---

**How to use your timeline:**

1. Go to Timeline in the main menu
2. See your current phase
3. Check off tasks as you complete them
4. Advance to the next phase when you're ready

**Pro tip:** The timeline is flexible. Complete tasks at your own pace. It's a guide, not a rule.

2. Click Invite Parent
3. Enter their email address
4. Click Send Invite
5. They'll get an email with an invite link

## Email 5: Pro Tips & Resources

**Subject:** 5 Pro Tips to Level Up Your Recruiting (Week 2 Check-in)

**Timing:** Day 14

**To:** User with 3+ days active

---

### Email Body

```
Hi [First Name],

Two weeks in! Here are 5 tips to get the most out of Recruiting Compass.

---

**Tip #1: Log interactions within 24 hours**
The closer you log interactions to when they happen, the better. Your notes will be fresher and more specific.

**Tip #2: Use your fit scores strategically**
Your fit scores aren't absolute truth—they're a tool. Use them to identify schools you might not have considered, but trust your gut about schools you love.

**Tip #3: Pay attention to coach responsiveness**
Coaches who reply quickly are usually more engaged. Use responsiveness scores to prioritize follow-ups.

**Tip #4: Customize your preferences**
The more detail you add to your profile (academic, athletic, location, major), the better our AI suggestions become.

**Tip #5: Review your progress monthly**
Spend 15 minutes at the start of each month reviewing:
- All interactions logged
- Fit scores for your top schools
- Timeline progress
- Upcoming milestones

---

## Email 6: Feature Spotlight - Fit Scores

**Subject:** Your Fit Scores Just Got Smarter (Here's How to Use Them)

**Timing:** Week 3 (every Monday)

**To:** Active users

---

### Email Body

```
Hi [First Name],

Fit scores are one of the most powerful features in Recruiting Compass. Here's how to use them effectively.

**What's a fit score?**

A fit score (1-10 scale) tells you how well a school matches your profile.

- 9-10: Perfect fit
- 7-8: Good fit
- 5-6: Moderate fit
- 3-4: Low fit
- 1-2: Poor fit

---

**What affects your fit score?**

Your fit score is based on:
✅ Academic alignment (your GPA vs. school standards)
✅ Athletic alignment (your stats vs. team recruitment focus)
✅ Location preference match
✅ Program performance and reputation
✅ Scholarship availability
✅ Coaching philosophy fit

---

**How to improve your fit scores:**

1. **Complete your profile** - The more info we have, the more accurate scores become
2. **Update your stats** - As you improve, update your athletic stats
3. **Set clear preferences** - Tell us which regions and divisions matter to you

---

**Pro tip:**
Don't ignore schools with lower fit scores if you're genuinely interested in them. Fit scores are a starting point, not the final say. Trust your instincts.
