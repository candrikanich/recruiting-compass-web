## Key Concepts

### Timeline Phases

Your recruiting journey follows a 4-year timeline:

| Phase | Grade | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Freshman** | 9th grade | Foundation: Build skills, get on coaches' radars |
| **Sophomore** | 10th grade | Active Outreach: Attend showcases, send intro emails |
| **Junior** | 11th grade | Peak Recruiting: Campus visits, build relationships |
| **Senior** | 12th grade | Decision: Narrow choices, commit |

You can advance phases anytime, but they're designed to guide you through the recruiting timeline naturally.

### Fit Score (1-10 Scale)

A score showing how well a school matches your academic, athletic, and personal goals.

- **9-10**: Perfect fit - Strong match across all areas
- **7-8**: Good fit - Strong academic/athletic match
- **5-6**: Moderate fit - Some areas align well
- **3-4**: Low fit - Few areas match
- **1-2**: Poor fit - Minimal alignment

Fit Score improves as you fill out your profile with academic and athletic info.

### Responsiveness Score

Shows how quickly a coach responds to you:
- **High**: Coach replies within 1-3 days
- **Medium**: Coach replies in 1-2 weeks
- **Low**: Coach takes 2+ weeks or doesn't respond

Use this to prioritize your recruiting efforts.

### Priority Tiers

Organize schools by likelihood and preference:

- **Reach Schools**: Dream schools (competitive, less likely)
- **Target Schools**: Realistic matches (good fit, competitive)
- **Safety Schools**: Likely admits (good fit, strong chance)

A balanced list typically has: 2-3 reach, 4-6 target, 2-3 safety schools.
