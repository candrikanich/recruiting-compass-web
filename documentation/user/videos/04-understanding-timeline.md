## Script

### [0:00-0:20] Intro

[Camera: Direct engagement, warm tone]

"College recruiting is a four-year journey. And if you don't have a plan, it can feel completely overwhelming. That's where the timeline in Recruiting Compass comes in. This is going to walk you through what you should be doing each year, from freshman year all the way through senior year."

[Screen: Show timeline section of app]

### [0:20-1:10] The Four Phases

[Screen: Display all four phases clearly]

"Let's break it down. There are four phases—one for each year. Freshman phase is all about exploration. You're getting to know schools, attending camps, building relationships with coaches. You're not in a rush."

[Screen: Highlight freshman phase, show description]

"Sophomore year is when you start getting more serious. You're building your target list, you're reaching out to coaches, you're attending showcases. You're starting to see who's interested in you."

[Screen: Move to sophomore phase]

"Junior year is showtime. This is when most coaches are actively recruiting you. Your stats are getting noticed, you're having serious conversations with coaches, you're figuring out where you want to go."

[Screen: Highlight junior phase]

"And senior year? That's decision time. You're narrowing down your choices, taking visits, signing letters of intent. By the end of senior year, you've made your college choice."

### [1:10-2:25] Tasks & Milestones

[Screen: Click into freshman phase to show tasks]

"Now, within each phase, there are specific tasks. These are things you should be doing to stay on track. Some of them are required before you can move to the next phase."

[Screen: Show task list for freshman phase]

"For example, in freshman year, one task is 'Build Target School List'—you need to identify 15-20 schools you're interested in. Another is 'Attend Summer Camp'—getting in front of coaches is important. Another is 'Log Initial Interactions'—start keeping track of who you're talking to."

[Screen: Highlight individual tasks, show descriptions]

"As you complete these tasks, you check them off. That keeps you on track and gives you a sense of progress. You can also see dependencies—like, you can't move to sophomore year until you've completed the key freshman tasks."

[Screen: Show task completion checkbox, demonstrate checking off a task]

"This is really valuable because it takes the guesswork out of recruiting. You don't have to wonder what you should be doing next. The timeline tells you."

[Screen: Show task details with dates and descriptions]

### [2:25-3:25] Advancing Phases

[Screen: Show phase advancement button/flow]

"When you've completed the core tasks for your current phase, you can advance to the next one. Let's say you've knocked out all the freshman tasks. You click 'Advance to Sophomore Phase', and now you've got a whole new set of tasks for sophomore year."

[Screen: Click advance button, show phase change animation]

"Your dashboard updates, your timeline updates, and you see a new set of focus areas. It's like leveling up in a video game, but for your recruiting journey."

[Screen: Show sophomore phase tasks appear]

"And here's the thing—even if you complete your current phase tasks early, you can keep working ahead. Some people advance early, some people take their time. The timeline is flexible. But it gives you a roadmap so you're not just wandering around wondering what to do."

[Screen: Show multiple tasks completed ahead of schedule]

### [3:25-4:00] Staying on Track

[Camera: Direct to camera, encouraging tone]

"The recruiting timeline can feel like a lot. Four years is a long time. But Recruiting Compass breaks it down into manageable pieces. You know what to do each year, each quarter, each month. And as you log interactions and complete tasks, you're building momentum. Before you know it, you're a senior making your final decision."

[Screen: Show dashboard with multiple phases, some completed, some in progress]

"Check your timeline regularly. Make it part of your recruiting routine. And remember—you're not racing anyone. This is your timeline at your pace."
