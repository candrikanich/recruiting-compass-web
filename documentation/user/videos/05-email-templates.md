## Script

### [0:00-0:20] Intro

[Camera: Direct engagement]

"One of the hardest parts of recruiting? Knowing what to say to coaches. Do you sound desperate? Overconfident? Too casual? That's where email templates come in. Recruiting Compass has templates for every situation you might encounter, so you can focus on your recruiting instead of staring at a blank email."

[Screen: Show templates section]

### [0:20-0:55] Browsing Templates

[Screen: Show template library with categories]

"When you go to the Templates section, you'll see different categories. There are templates for initial outreach to coaches you haven't met. There are templates for follow-ups after you've had contact. There are templates for after camps, after showcases, that kind of thing."

[Screen: Click through different template categories]

"Each template is professionally written, but they sound natural. They're not stuffy or overly formal. They sound like a real person reaching out to a coach."

[Screen: Show individual template preview]

"You can read through the template, see how it's structured, and decide if it's the right fit for your situation. And they're all totally customizable."

### [0:55-1:40] Customizing a Template

[Screen: Click "Use This Template" button, open editor]

"Let's say you're reaching out to a coach for the first time. You'd pick the 'Initial Outreach' template. Click it, and now you can customize it."

[Screen: Show template editor with merge fields highlighted]

"See these highlighted parts? Those are the places you customize. You put in the coach's name, the school, your stats—whatever's relevant. The template gives you the structure, you fill in the details."

[Screen: Fill in personalization fields (coach name, school, position, stats)]

"This takes like 30 seconds. And now you've got a professional, personalized email that's way better than whatever you would have written from scratch."

[Screen: Show filled-in template preview]

### [1:40-2:00] Sending & Tracking

[Camera: Direct to camera]

"Once you're happy with it, you can send it right from the app, or copy it and paste it into your email. Either way, when you send the email, log it in your interactions so you've got a record of it. That way you know who you've reached out to and when."

[Screen: Show send button options]

"Use the templates to stay professional, stay organized, and stop stressing about what to say. That's what they're here for!"
