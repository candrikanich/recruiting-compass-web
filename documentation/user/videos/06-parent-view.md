## Script

### [0:00-0:25] Intro

[Camera: Direct engagement, friendly tone]

"Hey parents! If you're helping your student-athlete navigate recruiting, this video's for you. Recruiting Compass has a special parent view so you can stay in the loop, get updates, and support your student without getting in the way."

[Screen: Show student dashboard with "Invite Parent" option]

### [0:25-1:10] Sending the Invite

[Screen: Navigate to settings or account management]

"The student athlete in the family starts by sending a parent an invite. You go to your settings, find the account section, and click 'Invite Parent'. You enter the parent's email address."

[Screen: Show invite form, enter parent email]

"We send an email to that parent with a link. They click the link, create their own account, and boom—they're connected to your recruiting account. Now they can see everything you're doing."

[Screen: Show invite email preview]

### [1:10-2:00] Parent Dashboard

[Screen: Show parent account logging in, entering parent dashboard]

"When a parent logs in, they see a parent-specific dashboard. This shows them all the schools you're interested in, your target list, your tiers. They can see your timeline progress—what phase you're in, what tasks you're completing."

[Screen: Display parent dashboard overview]

"They can see your interactions—what coaches have reached out, when you've reached out, notes about those conversations. They can see your performance metrics if you've been logging stats. They can see fit scores for each school."

[Screen: Show different sections—schools, interactions, timeline, stats]

"But here's the key thing—parents can see, but they can't edit. They can't change your interactions or mess with your timeline. They're observers. They're support. They're informed. But you're driving the ship."

[Screen: Show "View Only" indicators on parent view]

### [2:00-2:45] Staying Connected

[Screen: Show notification settings]

"Parents can also get notifications. So if you complete a major milestone, if a coach reaches out, if it's time to advance to the next phase—your parents can get an email about it. It keeps them in the loop without them having to log in constantly."

[Screen: Show email notification example]

"You can control what notifications your parents see and how often. Maybe you don't want them getting notified about every single interaction. That's fine. You set the preferences."

[Screen: Show notification preferences interface]

"This setup is great because it keeps your parents informed and engaged, but it respects the fact that this is your recruiting journey. You're the one driving decisions, reaching out to coaches, managing your timeline."

[Screen: Show both parent and student dashboards side by side]

### [2:45-3:00] Wrap Up

[Camera: Direct to camera, to both students and parents]

"Students—get your parents involved. They're a huge asset, and having them informed helps. Parents—support your student, ask questions if you don't understand something, but trust them to drive this. Together, Recruiting Compass helps you stay connected and organized. That's the goal!"
