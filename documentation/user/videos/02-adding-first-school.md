## Script

### [0:00-0:15] Intro

[Camera: Direct engagement]

"Let's talk about building your target school list. This is probably the most important part of the whole recruiting process. You need to know which schools to focus on, and Recruiting Compass makes it super easy."

[Screen: Show dashboard/schools section]

### [0:15-0:50] Search & Add

[Screen: Click "Add School" button, search interface appears]

"When you click 'Add School', a search pops up. You can search by name—Duke, Stanford, Rice—or you can browse by division, region, or whatever makes sense for you. Let's add a few schools to show you how it works."

[Screen: Type school name in search, show results appearing in real-time]

"See how schools pop up as you type? Super fast. Click the one you want, and it's added to your list instantly."

[Screen: Click on school, show it being added]

### [0:50-1:30] Setting Your Tiers

[Screen: Show school added, with tier selector visible]

"Now here's the key thing—you want to organize your schools into tiers. A reach school is one where your stats are below what they typically recruit. A target school is right in their wheelhouse. And a safety school is where your stats are above what they're looking for."

[Screen: Show three schools—one marked as reach (red), one as target (yellow), one as safety (green)]

"Why does this matter? Because it keeps you from getting caught up chasing schools that aren't realistic for you. You want a good mix—maybe five reach, eight target, five safety. Something like that."

[Screen: Add another school, demonstrate setting tier]

"You can also see fit scores for each school—that's a number from 1 to 10 that tells you how well you match with that school academically and athletically. Higher is better. We'll dive deeper into fit scores in another video, but for now, just know that this is a helpful guide when you're deciding whether to add a school to your list."

### [1:30-2:00] Organizing Your List

[Screen: Show list of 5+ schools with various tiers]

"As you build your list, you can sort and filter. You can see all your schools at once, or just your reach schools, or just your targets. You can also see new schools Recruiting Compass suggests for you based on your profile."

[Screen: Click filter buttons to show different views]

"Over time, this becomes your central recruiting headquarters. Every interaction you log, every coach who contacts you, every email you send—it all connects back to your school list. That's the power of having everything organized in one place."

[Screen: Show dashboard with populated school list]

### [2:00-2:15] Wrap Up

[Camera: Direct to camera]

"Pro tip: Don't overthink your initial list. You can add more schools, remove schools, change tiers—it's all flexible. The goal is to have a good starting point so you know where to focus your effort. Start with schools you're genuinely interested in, and build from there."

## Screen Directions

- **Search interface**: Show autocomplete working smoothly.
- **School cards**: Display name, location, division, fit score, tier selector.
- **Tier badges**: Use clear visual colors (reach: red, target: yellow, safety: green).
- **List view**: Show 5-8 schools with different tiers to demonstrate organization.
- **Filter buttons**: Show sorting/filtering in action.

## Tone Notes

- **Energy**: Helpful, not condescending.
- **Pacing**: Moderate—slower when explaining tiers, normal for actions.
- **Focus**: Help users understand WHY tiers matter, not just HOW to set them.

## Recording Tips

- Pause after tier selector appears to let it sink in.
- Use cursor highlight on tier buttons.
- Show filter/search results updating in real-time to demonstrate responsiveness.
