## Script

### [0:00-0:25] Intro

[Camera: Direct engagement, thoughtful tone]

"So you've added schools to your list. Now the question is—which schools are actually realistic for you? That's where fit scores come in. A fit score is a number from 1 to 10 that tells you how well you match with a school academically and athletically. Let's break down how it works."

### [0:25-1:15] The Five Components

[Screen: Show fit score breakdown diagram or visualization]

"A fit score is made up of five components, each weighted differently. First is academic fit—that's 30% of your score. We look at your GPA, your test scores, and the school's academic standards. Do your academics match what they're looking for? That's academic fit."

[Screen: Highlight academic component, show GPA matching]

"Second is athletic fit—also 30%. We look at your athletic performance, your stats, your position, and what the school needs. Are you the kind of athlete they're recruiting? Athletic fit captures that."

[Screen: Highlight athletic component, show stat comparison]

"Third is location fit—that's 15%. Some athletes care a lot about geography, some don't. Location fit considers the distance from home and whether the region matches your preferences."

"Fourth is program fit—15%. This is about the coaching style, the program's reputation, whether the playing style matches how you like to play. It's more subjective, but it matters."

[Screen: Highlight program component]

"And finally, financial fit—10%. Are they likely to offer you a scholarship? What's the financial aid situation? This component factors in scholarship availability for your position and profile."

"We add all five together, weight them appropriately, and you get a number from 1 to 10. That's your fit score."

### [1:15-2:30] What the Numbers Mean

[Screen: Show example schools with different fit scores]

"Let's talk about what these numbers actually mean. A fit score of 9 or 10? That's an excellent match. The school matches what you're looking for athletically and academically. These are target schools—schools where you have a real shot."

[Screen: Highlight high fit score schools (9-10), show they're in "Target" tier]

"A fit score of 6 to 8? Good match. Not perfect, but solid. You could play there, the academics make sense. These are also target schools, just maybe slightly less likely than the 9-10 group."

[Screen: Show mid-range fit scores]

"A fit score below 5? That's reaching. It doesn't mean don't apply, but it means this school is a reach for you. Maybe the academics are higher than your stats, or maybe the athletic level is more competitive. These are reach schools. You might get in, but you're betting on something going your way."

[Screen: Show low fit scores in "Reach" tier]

"And here's the thing—a fit score is not a prediction. A 9 doesn't mean you're guaranteed to get recruited. A 4 doesn't mean you can't. These schools have limited spots, lots of competition. A fit score just tells you how well you match on paper."

### [2:30-3:45] Using Fit Scores

[Screen: Go back to school list, show fit scores in context]

"So how do you use fit scores? Think of them as a filter. They help you figure out which schools are realistic for you. Instead of randomly reaching out to schools, you've got data to guide you."

[Screen: Sort schools by fit score, show distribution]

"If you're looking at your list and you've got mostly reach schools (fit score below 5), maybe you need to add more targets. If you've got mostly targets, maybe add a reach or two. A balanced list is ideal—some reaches, some targets, some safety schools."

[Screen: Show balanced school list breakdown]

"You should also be regularly updating your profile so the fit scores stay accurate. Log your stats, update your GPA, add your test scores. Better information means better fit scores."

[Screen: Show profile being updated, fit scores recalculating]

"And use fit scores to inform your outreach. Reach out to schools with high fit scores first. Get serious conversations going with those schools. This helps you focus your effort on the most realistic opportunities."

[Screen: Show interaction log with schools sorted by fit score]

### [3:45-4:00] Wrap Up

[Camera: Direct to camera]

"Fit scores are powerful because they're data-driven. They take the guesswork out of which schools make sense for you. Use them to build a balanced list, update your profile to keep them accurate, and focus your effort accordingly. It's that simple!"

## Screen Directions

- **Fit score visualization**: Show pie chart or bar chart breaking down five components.
- **Component explanations**: Use clear icons for each (books for academic, athlete for athletic, location pin, program badge, dollar sign for financial).
- **Fit score examples**: Show 3-4 schools with different fit scores (9, 7, 5, 3) and what they mean.
- **Tier assignment**: Show how fit score correlates to tier (reach/target/safety).
- **Profile update**: Show real-time fit score recalculation as stats update.
- **School list sorting**: Show list sorted by fit score with visual indicators.

## Tone Notes

- **Energy**: Clear, educational, data-driven.
- **Pacing**: Slower—this is important conceptual content with multiple parts.
- **Focus**: Demystify fit scores, make them actionable, reduce anxiety.
- **Honesty**: Be clear that fit scores are guides, not guarantees.

## Recording Tips

- Pause after each component explanation to let it sink in.
- Use cursor to highlight the percentage weights (30%, 30%, 15%, 15%, 10%).
- Show smooth animation as fit score components appear and combine.
- Use color coding to distinguish reach (red), target (yellow), safety (green).
- Show profile update triggering fit score recalculation in real-time.
