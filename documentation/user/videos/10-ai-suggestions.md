## Script

### [0:00-0:20] Intro

[Camera: Direct engagement]

"Here's something cool—Recruiting Compass is smart enough to help you stay on top of your recruiting. As you use the app, it's paying attention. It's watching your interactions, your timeline, your school list. And it's giving you smart suggestions about what to do next. Let me show you how it works."

### [0:20-1:10] Types of Suggestions

[Screen: Display different categories of suggestions]

"There are four main types of suggestions. First, follow-up suggestions. If a coach hasn't heard from you in a while, or you haven't heard from them in a while, Recruiting Compass will remind you. 'Hey, Coach Johnson from Duke hasn't heard from you in 45 days—maybe send a follow-up email.'"

[Screen: Highlight follow-up suggestion example]

"Second, fit suggestions. If Recruiting Compass identifies a school that matches your profile really well, it'll suggest it. You might not have found it on your own, but based on your stats and your preferences, this school could be a great fit."

[Screen: Show fit suggestion with explanation]

"Third, activity suggestions. These are based on your timeline phase. If you're a junior and you haven't attended any showcases yet this year, Recruiting Compass might suggest you find some showcases to attend. It's keeping you on track with what you should be doing based on your phase."

"And fourth, milestone suggestions. If you've completed all your current phase tasks, Recruiting Compass will tell you you're ready to advance to the next phase. It's basically saying, 'You've got this—time to level up.'"

### [1:10-2:15] Acting on Suggestions

[Screen: Show suggestion card with action button]

"When you see a suggestion, you can do one of three things. First, you can act on it. If it's a follow-up suggestion, you might click 'Send Email', and we'll pull up that email template for that coach. If it's a fit suggestion, you might click 'Add School' and add it to your list."

[Screen: Click on follow-up suggestion, show email template appearing]

"Second, you can dismiss it. Maybe you've got a good reason not to follow it. That's fine—just dismiss it and it goes away."

[Screen: Click dismiss, show suggestion disappearing]

"Third, you can ignore it. Maybe you'll deal with it later. The suggestion stays in your suggestions queue and you can come back to it anytime."

[Screen: Show multiple suggestions in queue]

### [2:15-2:55] The Big Picture

[Camera: Direct to camera, warm tone]

"Here's what's really cool about suggestions—they're your recruiting coach in your pocket. You've got a lot to remember. Your timeline, your interactions, which coaches you should follow up with, which schools to consider. Recruiting Compass is helping you stay on top of all of it. You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to remember everything. The app's got your back."

[Screen: Show dashboard with multiple suggestions active]

"Make it a habit to check your suggestions once a week. See what Recruiting Compass is recommending. Act on what makes sense, dismiss what doesn't. It's like having a mentor helping you stay organized and proactive."

"Recruiting is overwhelming. But with Recruiting Compass giving you smart suggestions every step of the way, you're not doing it alone. You've got support."
