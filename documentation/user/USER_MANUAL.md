## FAQ

### Getting Started

**Q: What do I need to get started?**

- An email address
- Basic info (high school, position, graduation year)
- Your GPA and/or test scores (optional; can add later)

**Q: Is Recruiting Compass free?**
Yes. All core features are completely free during the MVP phase. No credit card required.

**Q: Do I need a coach or advisor to use Recruiting Compass?**
No. Recruiting Compass is built for athletes and families to use independently. Coaches and advisors can recommend it, but they're not required.

**Q: Can I use this with my parents?**
Yes. You create the main account, then invite your parents. They get read-only access to your recruiting info.

### Using the App

**Q: How many schools should I track?**
Most athletes track 10-20 schools across all tiers:

- 2-3 reach schools (dream schools, long shot)
- 4-6 target schools (realistic matches)
- 2-3 safety schools (likely accepts)

You can adjust as you narrow your list or expand your search.

**Q: When should I start recruiting?**
Many athletes start as freshmen (age 14), but it's never too late. If you're a junior or senior, you can catch up by logging past interactions and focusing on active outreach.

**Q: How often should I update my profile?**
Update your profile when:

- Your GPA improves
- You get new test scores
- Your athletic stats improve
- Your recruiting preferences change

Quarterly reviews recommended.

**Q: How do I log an interaction with a coach who contacted me?**

1. Click the coach
2. Click "Log Interaction"
3. Select "Coach Email" as the type
4. Fill in the details of what they wrote
5. Log it

### Fit Scores & AI

**Q: How accurate are the fit scores?**
Fit scores are as accurate as your profile is complete. The more information you provide (academic, athletic, preferences), the more accurate the scores.

Consider fit scores as a starting point, not the final word. Trust your gut about schools you're genuinely interested in.

**Q: Can I disagree with my fit score?**
Absolutely. Fit scores are algorithms, not absolute truth. If you're interested in a school with a lower fit score, pursue it. Use fit scores as a tool, not a rule.

**Q: How do AI suggestions work?**
AI suggests actions based on:

- Your interaction patterns
- Your profile and preferences
- Industry-standard recruiting timelines
- What other successful athletes do

The AI learns from your behavior, so suggestions improve over time.

### Coach Communication

**Q: What if a coach doesn't respond to me?**

- Wait 1-2 weeks before following up
- Send a follow-up email with a specific question or update
- If still no response after 30 days, the AI will suggest a recovery plan
- Not all coaches are heavily recruiting—some are less responsive

**Q: Is it okay to text coaches?**

- Only if they give you their personal number
- Keep texts brief and professional
- Avoid texting late at night or early morning
- Email is usually the safer choice

**Q: How many times should I contact a coach?**

- Initial introduction email (1x)
- Follow-up if they don't respond (after 2 weeks)
- Follow-ups after events or meetings (1-2x per season)
- Avoid more than 1-2 emails per month unless they initiate more

### Privacy & Data

**Q: Will coaches know I'm tracking them?**
No. Coaches don't know you're using Recruiting Compass. You stay in control of your own data.

**Q: What information can I share with coaches?**
Only what you choose to share:

- You can share your performance stats (they're private by default)
- You can share your highlight film link
- You can share your performance trends
- You can link coaches to any public information

Coaches never see your internal notes or private data.

**Q: Can I download my data if I leave?**
Yes. Go to Settings > Privacy > "Export Your Data" to download all your information as a CSV file.

**Q: What happens to my data if I stop using Recruiting Compass?**
Your data stays in your account. You can come back anytime and everything will still be there. If you delete your account, all data is permanently deleted.

### Recruiting Process

**Q: What's the difference between an official visit and an unofficial visit?**

- **Unofficial Visit**: You visit campus on your own (anytime). Coaches can't pay for it.
- **Official Visit**: School pays for your travel and housing (allowed only for D1/D2 prospects, usually junior/senior year). Coaches coordinate it.

Both types should be logged in Recruiting Compass.

**Q: What's a recruiting survey?**
A form coaches send asking about your academics, athletics, and interests. They use responses to evaluate you as a recruit. Complete thoroughly and return promptly.

**Q: When should I commit to a school?**
This is a personal decision, but generally:

- Freshman/Sophomore: Don't commit yet (too early)
- Junior: Some athletes commit (especially if they love the school)
- Senior: Most athletes commit by fall/winter
- Signing Day: National Signing Day (February for baseball)

**Q: What if I'm not getting recruited?**

- You might be early in your recruiting journey (freshman/sophomore year is common)
- Coaches might not know about you yet (showcase tournaments help)
- Your stats might not match schools' recruiting criteria
- Reach out to coaches yourself (don't wait for them to find you)
- Consider attending more showcases or camps
