## Slide 1: Title Slide

### Content

- **Logo**: Recruiting Compass logo
- **Headline**: "Navigate Your College Recruiting Journey with Confidence"
- **Tagline**: "The all-in-one platform for student-athletes and families"
- **Visual**: Baseball imagery (player, field) or family together

### Speaker Notes

"Good morning/afternoon. My name is [Name] and I'm excited to share Recruiting Compass, a solution to a problem affecting 50,000+ families every year: how to organize and manage the college baseball recruiting process."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem (Part 1)

### Content

**Pain Point 1: Information Chaos**

- Spreadsheets, emails, text threads
- No centralized contact info or communication history
- Easy to miss follow-ups and deadlines
- Parents and athletes operate in silos

### Visual

Chaotic image: Spreadsheets, text messages, email screenshots scattered

### Speaker Notes

"Right now, families are tracking recruiting across multiple platforms. Spreadsheets for schools, email threads for coaches, group texts for family discussions, calendars for deadlines. It's chaos."

---

## Slide 3: The Problem (Part 2)

### Content

**Pain Point 2: Timeline Uncertainty**

- Recruiting spans 4 years (no roadmap)
- Families don't know what to focus on when
- Missed recruiting windows and deadlines
- Reactive vs. proactive decisions

### Visual

Timeline showing 4 years with question marks

### Speaker Notes

"Most families don't have a roadmap. They don't know if they should be attending showcases this summer, what phase their athlete should be in, or what recruiting windows they're missing."

---

## Slide 4: The Problem (Part 3)

### Content

**Pain Point 3: Decision Complexity**

- 1,000+ colleges with baseball
- No systematic way to evaluate fit
- Hidden signals (coach responsiveness, program quality)
- High-stakes decision with incomplete info

### Visual

Decision tree or overwhelmed person surrounded by school logos

### Speaker Notes

"Then there's the decision itself. Over 1,000 colleges offer baseball. How do you know which ones are right for you? You can look at rankings, but that doesn't tell you about coaching philosophy or whether coaches are actually interested in recruiting you."

---

## Slide 5: Market Opportunity

### Content

**The Opportunity**

- **50,000+** families enter college baseball recruiting annually
- **TAM**: $25M+ (college recruiting SaaS for families)
- **Current Solution**: Fragmented (spreadsheets, email, separate apps)
- **Willingness to Pay**: $5-20/month for organization + insights

### Visual

### Speaker Notes

"This isn't niche. We're talking about 50,000 families every year navigating this. Most of them are already paying $2-5K for showcases, camps, and coaching. They'd gladly pay a small subscription for a tool that actually helps."
