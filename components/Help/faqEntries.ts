    question: "Why don't you show an Athletic Fit or Opportunity Fit score?",
    answer:
      "We intentionally don't — only a coach knows what they're looking for and what roster spots are open. A fabricated score would give false confidence. Talk to the coach directly for that read.",

    id: "template-hidden",
    category: "coaches",
    question: "Why is a message template hidden for a school?",
    answer:
      "Some sports and divisions have an NCAA contact period. Outside that window, the template auto-swaps to a pre-window version — it's not a bug, and it never blocks outreach entirely.",

    id: "task-locked",
    category: "timeline",
    question: "Why is a task locked?",
    answer:
      "Some tasks depend on earlier ones finishing first, to keep your recruiting progression logical. Complete the dependency and the lock clears automatically.",

    id: "share-document",
    category: "tracking",
    question: "Why can't a school see a document I uploaded?",
    answer:
      "Uploading a document doesn't share it automatically — you choose which schools can see it. Open the document and add the school under sharing.",
