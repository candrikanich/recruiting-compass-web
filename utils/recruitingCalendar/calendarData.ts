/**
 * NCAA 2026-27 recruiting-calendar dataset — transcribed from the official
 * NCAA S3-hosted PDFs (per-sport recruiting calendars, ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com).
 *
 * Every `SportCalendar.source` cites the exact PDF it was transcribed from;
 * `verifiedOn` is the date a human/agent last checked the transcription against
 * that PDF. Every period carries a `confidence` (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) reflecting
 * how directly the PDF (and any cross-checks) support that exact date range.
 *
 * Source fragments (read, not re-fetched, to build this file):
 * - p2-spike-mba-calendar.md            → MBA
 * - p2-data-softball-basketball.md      → WSB, MBB, WBB
 * - p2-data-football-track.md           → FBS, FCS, XCTF
 * - p2-data-vball-golf-lacrosse.md      → WVB, MGO, MLA, WLA
 * - p2-data-other-d2.md                 → Other (D1 "All Other Sports"), D2_ALL
 *
 * Edge cases applied (locked, see plan):
 * - MBB "TBD" combine windows (NBA G League Combine, NBA Draft Combine, NBPA
 *   Top 100 Camp) are omitted — the PDF gives no concrete date, only "TBD".
 * - MLA "@ NOON" boundaries are rounded to the day; "(effective noon)" is
 *   appended to the description to preserve the intraday detail.
 * - MBB legend term "Recruiting Period" maps to `contact` (closest of the 5
 *   required types; the legend's own definition text matches other sports'
 *   "Contact Period" definition).
