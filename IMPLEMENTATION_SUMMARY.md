## 🎯 What This Enables

### For Students

- ✅ Individual family unit ownership
- ✅ Full data creation rights (schools, coaches, interactions)
- ✅ Private notes for personal thoughts
- ✅ Clean, student-focused UI

### For Parents

- ✅ View all children's recruiting data
- ✅ Seamless athlete switching (dropdown or route param)
- ✅ Read-only access to shared notes
- ✅ Own private notes per child
- ✅ Cannot create interactions (students only)
- ✅ Multi-family support (if multiple kids)

### For System

```

---

## 🚀 How to Proceed

### Step 1: Apply Migrations (CRITICAL - Do This First)

```bash
# Navigate to Supabase SQL Editor

# Copy entire contents of 021_create_family_units.sql and run
# Copy entire contents of 022_backfill_family_data.sql and run

# Verify validation output shows 100% family_unit_id coverage

# Regenerate types:
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > types/database.ts
```

**Why:** All composables depend on these tables. TypeScript needs updated definitions.

### Step 2: Update Remaining Composables (3-4 hours)

Follow `PHASE_4_NEXT_STEPS.md`:

1. Update `useCoaches.ts` (simplest - copy-paste pattern from useSchools)
2. Update `useInteractions.ts` (add student-only check)
3. Update `useAccountLinks.ts` (integrate family creation)

Each has code examples provided in the next steps document.

### Step 3: Build UI Components (6-8 hours)

From `PHASE_4_NEXT_STEPS.md`:

1. `AthleteSelector.vue` - Parent switching dropdown
2. `PrivateNotesCard.vue` - User private notes display
3. Update existing components (SchoolCard, pages/schools/index.vue)

### Step 4: API Endpoints (4-5 hours)

From `PHASE_4_NEXT_STEPS.md`:

1. Modify `POST /api/account-links/confirm.post.ts` (add family creation)
2. Create `POST /api/family/create.post.ts` (backup creation)
3. Create `GET /api/family/members.get.ts` (fetch members)

### Step 5: Comprehensive Testing (6-8 hours)

- Unit tests for new composables
- Integration tests for workflows
- E2E tests for user stories

## ⚡ Quick Reference: Key Concepts

### ActiveFamily Context

Use in any component:

```typescript
const { activeFamilyId, activeAthleteId, isViewingAsParent } = useActiveFamily();

// For queries:
.eq("family_unit_id", activeFamilyId.value)
```

### Private Notes

Per-user only (family members can't see):

```typescript
const { getNote, saveNote, deleteNote } = useUserNotes();

await saveNote("school", schoolId, "My private thoughts");
const myNote = await getNote("school", schoolId);
```

### Query Pattern Change

**OLD:** `.eq("user_id", userStore.user.id)`
**NEW:** `.eq("family_unit_id", activeFamily.activeFamilyId.value)`

### Student-Only Enforcement

**Database Level:** RLS policy blocks non-students from creating interactions
**Application Level:** Add check in `useInteractions.createInteraction()`

## 🛡️ Safety Features Built In

1. **Backup Tables**
   - Migration 022 creates backups before changes
   - Can restore if issues occur
   - Keep for 24-48 hours, then clean up

2. **Validation Queries**
   - Migration 022 includes 5 validation checks
   - Verifies 100% backfill coverage
   - Checks family structure integrity

3. **Rollback Procedure**
   - Documented in `FAMILY_UNITS_MIGRATION.md`
   - Step-by-step instructions provided
   - No data loss if needed

4. **RLS Safety**
   - Hard-blocked at database (no way to bypass)
   - DELETE still scoped to creator (user_id)
   - Students can't accidentally see parents' notes

## 🎓 Learning: Key Patterns Used

### 1. Family-Based Access Control

```sql
-- Replace user-based filtering:
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()

-- With family-based:
WHERE family_unit_id IN (SELECT * FROM get_user_family_ids())
```

### 2. Composable Context Pattern

```typescript
// useActiveFamily provides reactive context
const { activeFamilyId, activeAthleteId } = useActiveFamily();

// Use in other composables
const fetchSchools = async () => {
  // queries automatically scoped to family
  .eq("family_unit_id", activeFamilyId.value)
}
```

### 3. Helper Functions for Reuse

```sql
-- Defined once in migration, used in all policies
GET user_family_ids() → returns accessible families
is_parent_viewing_athlete(id) → checks parent access
```

## 🔗 Related Decisions Made (From Plan Approval)

1. ✅ **Parent Athlete Switching**
   - Seamless UI dropdown (not separate URLs)
   - localStorage persistence across sessions
   - Route query param support for direct access

2. ✅ **Data Scoping**
   - Schools belong to family (student creates)
   - Parents can't create schools
   - Single scope per family (no cross-sibling sharing)

3. ✅ **Notes Privacy**
   - Strict privacy: only creator can see
   - Parents can't see each other's notes
   - Students see only shared notes

4. ✅ **Unlink Behavior**
   - Automatic removal (no confirmation needed)
   - Parent removed from family immediately
   - Data stays with remaining members

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics (Final State)

When fully implemented, you should have:

- ✅ 100% of students with family units
- ✅ 100% of data has family_unit_id
- ✅ Parents viewing student data with one click
- ✅ Students can't be blocked from creating interactions
- ✅ Private notes truly private
- ✅ Multi-kid families working seamlessly
- ✅ Query performance < 200ms
- ✅ Zero data loss
- ✅ All tests passing

## 🚀 You're 40% Done!

The hard part (database design, RLS policies, core composables) is complete.
Remaining work is mostly implementing UI and testing.

**Next session focus:** Apply migrations → Update composables → Build UI
