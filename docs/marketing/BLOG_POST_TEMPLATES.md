**Body:**

Imagine this: You're a junior in high school, and 10 colleges have sent recruiting emails. You've been to three summer camps where coaches expressed interest. Your parents are asking for updates, but you're not sure who's genuinely interested and who's just casting a wide net.

This is the reality of college recruiting—and it's overwhelming.

Today, we're launching **Recruiting Compass**, a free platform designed specifically for student-athletes and families navigating college recruiting. For years, athletes have managed this complexity with spreadsheets, email threads, and sticky notes. Not anymore.

### The Problem

College recruiting is inherently complex. Consider what a typical student-athlete is managing:

- **20+ schools** to track and evaluate
- **Dozens of coach interactions** across different channels (email, text, phone, in-person)
- **A four-year timeline** with unclear milestones and expectations
- **Family involvement** that needs to stay informed without taking over
- **Limited information** about school fit and realistic opportunities

Add to this the pressure of making one of life's biggest decisions, and recruiting becomes less of an opportunity and more of a burden.

Existing solutions don't help. Spreadsheets are clunky and don't provide insights. Email makes it impossible to see patterns. Separate apps for different needs create fragmentation.

Athletes need a single platform that brings it all together.

### The Solution

Recruiting Compass is built for student-athletes and families. It brings clarity to the recruiting chaos by organizing everything in one place:

**School List Management:** Add unlimited schools and organize them by tier (reach, target, safety). Get instant fit scores that show how well you match with each school academically and athletically. Know at a glance which schools are realistic opportunities.

**Coach Interaction Tracking:** Log every interaction—emails, calls, texts, in-person meetings. See when coaches reached out and when you responded. Track responsiveness scores to understand which coaches are genuinely interested. Never wonder "when did Coach Johnson email me?" again.

**Recruiting Timeline:** Follow a clear four-year recruiting timeline with phase-specific tasks. Freshman year is about exploration. Sophomore year is about getting serious. Junior year is showtime. Senior year is decision time. Stay on track with milestones and goals.

**Parent Collaboration:** Invite parents to view your progress without giving them control. They can see your school list, interaction history, and timeline, so they're informed and supportive—not intrusive.

**Smart Suggestions:** Our AI watches your recruiting journey and offers intelligent suggestions. Coaches haven't heard from you in a while? We'll suggest a follow-up. You've completed your phase tasks? We'll let you know you're ready to advance. You need guidance? We've got you.

### Why We Built This

The founding team has worked with hundreds of student-athletes and families. We heard the same frustration again and again: "Why isn't there a single place to manage all of this?"

We realized the market was missing a solution built specifically for the recruiting journey—one that's simple, family-friendly, and actually useful. So we built it.

### Free for Everyone

Recruiting Compass is **100% free**. No credit card required. No hidden fees. No premium tiers.

We believe every student-athlete deserves access to the tools that help them make informed decisions. Cost shouldn't be a barrier.

### POST 2: How to Build Your Target School List in 10 Minutes

**Headline:**
How to Build Your Target School List in 10 Minutes (The Smart Way)

**Subheading:**
A step-by-step guide to identifying and organizing schools that are realistic opportunities for you.

**Featured Image:**

---

**Body:**

One of the most important—and overwhelming—parts of college recruiting is building your target school list. You need to identify schools where you have a real shot, which means understanding your own profile and knowing what different schools are looking for.

Most student-athletes start by randomly researching schools or asking teammates for recommendations. This leads to lists that are either too aggressive (all reach schools) or too conservative (all safety schools).

This guide will show you how to build a balanced, realistic school list in just 10 minutes using data and strategy.

### Step 1: Understand Your Profile (2 minutes)

First, get honest about your profile:

**Athletic Profile:**

- What's your position?
- What are your key stats? (ERA, batting average, velocity, etc.)
- How do you compare to college athletes at your position?
- What's your percentile in your region? Top 25%? Top 50%?

**Academic Profile:**

- What's your GPA?
- What are your test scores (SAT/ACT)?
- What are you looking to study?

**Personal Preferences:**

- How far are you willing to go from home?
- What climate/region interests you?
- What about coaching style matters to you?
- How important is scholarship money?

Write these down. You need this information for the next steps.

### Step 2: Identify Division Level (1 minute)

Where do you belong athletically?

- **Division 1 (D1):** Highest level, most competitive, most scholarships. If you're in the top 5% athletically, consider D1.
- **Division 2 (D2):** Strong programs, good scholarships, less intense recruiting. Top 25% athletically.
- **Division 3 (D3):** No scholarships, but excellent programs and academics. Top 50% athletically.
- **NAIA/JUCO:** Alternative paths. Consider if D1/D2/D3 aren't realistic.

Be realistic here. It's better to be a recruited athlete at D2 than a walk-on at D1.

### Step 3: Research School Categories (3 minutes)

Create three categories:

**Reach Schools (Your stats are below their averages)**
Example: Your ERA is 3.5, their typical pitcher ERA is 2.8

- Usually 5-7 schools
- Teams you'd love to play for
- Long-shot opportunities
- Still realistic (not impossible)

**Target Schools (Your stats align with their averages)**
Example: Your ERA is 2.8, their typical pitcher ERA is 2.8

- Usually 8-12 schools
- Where you have the best shot
- Most of your recruiting focus goes here
- Good balance of challenge and opportunity

**Safety Schools (Your stats are above their averages)**
Example: Your ERA is 2.8, their typical pitcher ERA is 3.2

- Usually 5-7 schools
- Where you're almost certain to be recruited
- Don't overlook these—they might be perfect
- Gives you recruiting peace of mind

### Step 4: Build Your Reach List (2 minutes)

Start with schools you'd love to attend. Research 5-7 schools at the reach level.

For each school, find:

- What's their typical recruit look like?
- Average ERA/stats for your position
- How competitive is their recruiting class?

Resources:

- Perfect Game rankings
- College Baseball websites
- Coaching staff social media
- Baseball America

Write down 5-7 schools.

### Step 5: Build Your Target List (3 minutes)

Now for your realistic opportunities. This should be your biggest list—8-12 schools where your stats actually match.

Look for schools where:

- Your stats are within range of typical recruits
- You fit the coaching style
- The program is headed where you want to go
- Geography works for you

Write down 8-12 schools.

### Step 6: Build Your Safety List (2 minutes)

Finally, identify 5-7 schools where you're above their typical recruit profile.

These are schools where:

- Your stats exceed what they typically get
- You're a strong fit athletically
- Academics align
- You'd be genuinely happy attending

Write down 5-7 schools.

### Step 7: Organize & Review (2 minutes)

Now you have 18-26 schools organized into tiers. Review:

- Does this list feel balanced?
- Are your reach schools truly long-shots (not impossible)?
- Do your target schools feel realistic?
- Would you be happy going to any of your safety schools?

If not, adjust. Replace a reach school if you added one just because of brand name. Add another target if you don't have enough realistic options.

### Why This Approach Works

This tiering strategy works because:

1. **It's realistic:** You're not wasting time on schools that don't want you
2. **It's motivating:** You have schools where you have a real shot
3. **It's balanced:** You have options at different levels
4. **It reduces anxiety:** You know where you stand

### Next Steps: From List to Action

Once you have your list, it's time to act:

1. **Research each school** - Visit campus if possible, watch game footage, follow social media
2. **Reach out to coaches** - Email initial contact, use templates, be professional
3. **Log interactions** - Keep track of who reached out and when
4. **Monitor fit scores** - See how you match as your profile changes
5. **Update as you grow** - Your list might change as you improve athletically

### Pro Tips

**Tip 1: Don't base your list on brand alone.** That D1 school everyone knows about might not be a good fit for you. Look for schools where you match the profile.

**Tip 2: Add schools throughout the process.** Your list will evolve. As you get stronger, add more reaches. As you get feedback from coaches, adjust your targets.

**Tip 3: Talk to coaches.** The best way to understand where a school sees you is to email coaches and ask. They'll give you honest feedback about your fit.

**Tip 4: Get family input.** Parents often see things we miss. Run your list by them and listen to their perspective.

**Tip 5: Balance ambition with realism.** Dream big—but also have a realistic plan. The best recruiting lists have both.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too many reach schools:** If your entire list is reaches, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. You need targets where you have a real shot.

❌ **No safety schools:** Don't skip safety schools thinking they're beneath you. You want options.

❌ **Ignoring school culture:** The perfect stats fit might be a terrible culture fit. Consider the whole picture.

❌ **Forgetting about academics:** You need to stay eligible. Don't target schools where you can't maintain eligibility.

❌ **Not updating your list:** Your profile changes. Your stats improve (hopefully). Update your list as you grow.

### Conclusion

Building a strong target school list is the foundation of recruiting success. This approach gives you clarity about where you stand and where you should focus your energy.

Remember: The goal isn't to get into the most prestigious school. The goal is to find the right school for you—one where you'll play, where you'll fit, and where you'll thrive.

Start with this framework. Build your list. And then attack it with focus and intention.

### POST 3: 5 Mistakes Parents Make in College Baseball Recruiting (And How to Avoid Them)

5 Critical Mistakes Parents Make in College Baseball Recruiting (And How to Avoid Them)

**Subheading:**
Learn from common recruiting pitfalls so you can support your student-athlete effectively without sabotaging their opportunities.

---

**Body:**

If your son or daughter is a baseball player, you know how intense the recruiting process can be. As a parent, you want to help. But navigating recruiting waters can be tricky—there are plenty of ways to inadvertently hurt your student's chances.

I've worked with hundreds of families going through recruiting. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. Here are the five most common mistakes parents make—and how to avoid them.

### Mistake #1: Waiting for Coaches to Contact You (Instead of Being Proactive)

**The Problem:**
Many parents think, "If my son is good enough, coaches will find him." This is outdated thinking.

Coaches are busy. They recruit at camps, tournaments, and showcases. Unless your player is one of the top 1% in the country, they won't come looking. Your son needs to be proactive.

**Why it matters:**
Teams have limited scholarships. They get hundreds of emails from interested players. If your son isn't reaching out, he's competing against players who are. It's that simple.

**What to do instead:**

- Encourage your son to identify schools he's interested in
- Help him research coaches at those schools
- Support him in writing emails to coaches (even if he doesn't mail them)
- Attend showcases where coaches are recruiting (don't hide your player)
- Consider elite camps in the summer where coaches are actively recruiting

The key: Early contact is better than late contact. Start freshman year if possible. Definitely sophomore year.

### Mistake #2: Not Tracking Interactions Carefully (Leading to Missed Opportunities)

**The Problem:**
Recruiting involves dozens of conversations. Emails come in. Coaches call. Texts arrive. Conversations happen at tournaments.

If you're not tracking this, information gets lost.

I've seen it happen: A coach sent an email saying "I'd love to talk more," but the family missed it because the email was buried. Three months later, they wondered why that coach went quiet.

**Why it matters:**
Your son's recruiting success depends on being responsive and organized. If you miss a coach's message or forget what you discussed, it makes your player look disorganized. Coaches want organized, prepared players.

**What to do instead:**

- Keep a log of all coach interactions (email, call, text, in-person)
- Note the date, what was discussed, and what comes next
- Set reminders for follow-ups
- Keep all recruiting materials in one place
- Use a tool like Recruiting Compass to stay organized

Pro tip: Coaches notice when players are organized. It's an indicator of maturity and professionalism.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Fit and Chasing Brand Names

**The Problem:**
Parents often say things like, "We're targeting Duke, Stanford, and UCLA." These are great schools—but are they realistic for your player?

Many families ignore the reality that their player might not fit those schools athletically or academically. They chase brand names instead of building a realistic list.

**Why it matters:**
Recruiting is about finding the right fit—not about going to the most famous school. Your player is more likely to play and be happy at a school where they're a realistic fit.

Example: Your player might get recruited to play at a small Division II program where they're wanted, or be a walk-on at a Division I program that doesn't want them. The former is almost always the better choice.

**What to do instead:**

- Be honest about your player's athletic and academic profile
- Research realistic schools where your son fits the recruit profile
- Build a balanced list: 5-7 reach schools, 8-12 target schools, 5-7 safety schools
- Consider what "fit" means: coaching style, location, academic rigor, level of play
- Talk to coaches directly about where your player fits in their recruiting priorities

Better question: "Where does my son have the best shot of playing and being happy?" Not: "Can we get into this famous program?"

### Mistake #4: Not Involving the Family in the Process Proactively

**The Problem:**
Some parents try to manage recruiting entirely on their own. Others completely hand it off to their player without guidance.

Either approach creates problems. Recruiting is a family decision, and families should be aligned.

**Why it matters:**
Your player needs support. They're managing school, sports, and life while also managing recruiting. Parents who understand the process can provide intelligent support.

At the same time, it's your player's future. They need to drive the process and make their own decisions. Parents should advise, not control.

**What to do instead:**

- Have family discussions about recruiting goals early (freshman year)
- Make sure everyone understands the timeline and process
- Help your player think through what matters in a school (academics, coaching, location, etc.)
- Attend tournaments and showcases together when possible
- Review recruiting materials together and provide feedback
- Let your player take the lead on outreach to coaches

The goal: Family alignment without parent takeover. Your player is learning decision-making skills—let them.

### Mistake #5: Rushing the Decision (Instead of Taking Time to Be Sure)

**The Problem:**
Some players commit early. That works sometimes. But I've seen many families rush a decision and regret it.

"We got an offer, so we committed" isn't a good strategy. Offers can come anytime. Just because a coach wants you now doesn't mean that school is right for you.

**Why it matters:**
College is a four-year commitment. Your player will spend more time at this school than anywhere else in their life (besides childhood). The school choice matters.

Recruiting happens over four years for a reason. You should take time to understand your options.

**What to do instead:**

- Set a decision timeline with your player (most players commit junior or senior year)
- Keep recruiting open longer than your player wants to
- Encourage your player to explore multiple options
- Visit multiple campuses before deciding
- Talk to current players at the schools you're considering
- Make sure the academic fit is real
- Wait until you have multiple offers to make a decision if possible

Final decision should be: "This is the best option for me academically, athletically, and personally." Not just: "They offered, so I'm committing."

### The Bigger Picture

These five mistakes come down to one thing: **Not having a clear recruiting strategy.**

The best families approach recruiting like a project. They:

1. Set clear goals (what schools fit? what timeline makes sense?)
2. Create a plan (how will we reach out? how will we track progress?)
3. Execute consistently (contact coaches, attend showcases, track interactions)
4. Adjust based on feedback (coaches tell you where you stand—listen)
5. Make decisions thoughtfully (take time, explore options, choose wisely)

### How Recruiting Compass Helps

Many of these mistakes happen because families lack good systems. Without a central place to track interactions, it's easy to miss opportunities. Without a clear school list, it's easy to chase brand names.

Recruiting Compass solves this:

- **Organize schools** by tier so you focus on realistic targets
- **Track interactions** so you never miss a coach's message
- **Follow a timeline** with clear milestones
- **Invite parents** so your family stays aligned
- **Get suggestions** to stay on track

The result: You avoid these five mistakes and give your player the best shot at recruiting success.

### Final Advice

Recruiting can feel overwhelming. But if you approach it with strategy, stay organized, and focus on fit, your player will find the right school.

Your job as a parent is to support, not control. Trust your player to drive the process. Help them stay organized. Make sure the family is aligned. And give them the tools to succeed.

That's the formula.

### Ready to Get Organized?

If you want to avoid these mistakes and give your player the best shot at recruiting success, start by getting organized.
