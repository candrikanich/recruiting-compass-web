### Testimonial

> _"I would have been lost without the timeline. Freshman year I didn't know if I should be emailing coaches. The timeline told me to focus on skill development and showcases. By senior year, I knew exactly what stage I was in and what came next."_ — Sarah, Student-Athlete, Class of 2025

### Why This Feature Matters

Recruiting is a 4-year marathon, not a sprint. Most families don't have a plan—they react to emails and opportunities as they come. Athletes get confused about what they should be doing. Parents feel out of the loop.

The timeline solves this. It provides structure, clarity, and confidence. Athletes know they're doing the right thing at the right time. Parents understand the process. Families make better decisions.

## Feature 2: Data-Driven Fit Scores

### Headline

**Stop Guessing. Understand School Fit with AI-Powered Matching**

### One-Line Description

Get a fit score (1-10 scale) for every school based on your academic, athletic, and personal profile.

### Feature Overview (2-3 Sentences)

With 1,000+ colleges offering baseball, how do you know which ones are actually a good fit? Recruiting Compass analyzes your academics, athleticism, location preferences, and goals to give each school a fit score. No more guessing—understand exactly why a school is (or isn't) right for you.

### Key Benefits

✅ **Understand School Fit**: See why schools match or don't match your profile
✅ **Find Hidden Matches**: Discover schools you might not have considered
✅ **Make Smarter Decisions**: Compare schools objectively, not just by ranking or reputation
✅ **Save Time**: Focus your recruiting efforts on schools where you actually fit
✅ **Improve Over Time**: As your stats improve, fit scores update automatically

### How Fit Scores Are Calculated

Fit scores (1-10 scale) consider five factors:

**1. Academic Fit (30%)**

- Your GPA vs. the school's typical student GPA
- Your test scores vs. admitted students
- Your major vs. available programs

**2. Athletic Fit (30%)**

- Your stats vs. the team's roster
- Your position vs. team needs
- Your improvement trajectory vs. program standards

**3. Location Fit (15%)**

- Distance from home
- Your stated geographic preferences
- Regional competitiveness

**4. Program Fit (15%)**

- Team performance and reputation
- Coaching philosophy (where available)
- Conference competitiveness

**5. Financial Fit (10%)**

- School's scholarship availability
- Financial aid offerings
- Your financial needs

### Real-World Example

**Comparing Three Schools**

| Metric          | Stanford          | Arizona State        | Cal State Monterey |
| --------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Academic**    | 9 (excellent)     | 7 (good)             | 6 (moderate)       |
| **Athletic**    | 8 (strong match)  | 9 (excellent)        | 7 (good)           |
| **Location**    | 4 (far)           | 8 (preferred region) | 9 (ideal)          |
| **Program**     | 9 (top tier)      | 8 (strong)           | 6 (emerging)       |
| **Financial**   | 5 (expensive)     | 8 (scholarships)     | 8 (affordable)     |
| **Overall Fit** | **7/10 Good Fit** | **8/10 Great Fit**   | **7/10 Good Fit**  |

**What this tells you:**

- Stanford is prestigious but expensive and far—not ideal unless willing to sacrifice location
- Arizona State is a great all-around fit with good scholarship money and preferred location
- Cal State Monterey is ideal for location and affordability, but program is less established

### How to Improve Your Fit Score

1. **Complete Your Profile**
   - Add all academic info (GPA, test scores, major)
   - Add athletic stats (speed, exit velo, etc.)
   - Set clear preferences (divisions, regions, school size)

2. **Update Your Stats Regularly**
   - As your speed improves, update your 60-yard dash
   - Track batting average, ERA, fielding percentage
   - New test scores improve academic fit

3. **Be Specific About Preferences**
   - "Pacific coast only" vs. "anywhere"
   - "D1 only" vs. "D1/D2/D3"
   - "Engineering program" vs. any major

### Testimonial

> _"Fit scores completely changed how I thought about schools. I was fixated on D1 schools, but the algorithm showed me a D2 that was a way better fit. I visited it, loved it, and committed. Best decision I could have made."_ — Michael, Student-Athlete, Class of 2024

### Why This Feature Matters

Most recruiting advice is generic: "Look for schools where you match athletically" or "Apply to schools where your GPA is in range." But recruiting is more nuanced. It's about fit across multiple dimensions.

Fit scores level the playing field. Athletes can now make data-driven decisions instead of relying on hunches, brand names, or what their friends are doing. Families get objective comparisons to inform tough decisions.

### One-Line Description

Invite parents to see your schools, coaches, interactions, and timeline in real-time—while you stay in control.

### Feature Overview (2-3 Sentences)

Recruiting is a family decision, but most families operate in silos—athlete texting coaches, parents hearing about opportunities days later. Recruiting Compass lets you invite parents to see everything in real-time. They get visibility and peace of mind. You stay in control. No more miscommunication.

### Key Benefits

### How Parent Accounts Work

**What Parents Can See:**

- ✅ All target schools and coaches
- ✅ All interactions (emails, calls, visits)
- ✅ Complete interaction history and timeline
- ✅ Performance stats and fit scores
- ✅ Timeline progress
- ✅ Upcoming events and deadlines
- ✅ Notifications of important milestones

**What Parents Cannot Do:**

- ❌ Log interactions on your behalf
- ❌ Change your profile
- ❌ (You stay in full control)

### How to Invite Parents (1 Minute)

### Real-World Family Scenario

**The Problem (Before Recruiting Compass)**

Monday: Athlete gets email from Coach Smith
Tuesday: Athlete tells parents over dinner (maybe)
Wednesday: Parents ask more questions, athlete doesn't remember details
Thursday: Parents unsure if offer is real or just preliminary interest
Friday: Coach sends follow-up email, athlete doesn't tell parents for 3 days
Weekend: Parents frustrated because they're out of the loop

**The Solution (With Recruiting Compass)**

Monday: Athlete gets email from Coach Smith
→ Logs interaction in Recruiting Compass
→ Parents get notification immediately
Tuesday: Whole family discusses email over dinner
Wednesday: Parents review full interaction history if they have questions
Thursday: Coach sends follow-up email
→ Logged immediately
→ Parents see it in real-time
Friday: Family makes decision together with full information

### Testimonial

> _"My husband and I were so confused about my daughter's recruiting. With Recruiting Compass, we can see everything happening. We know which coaches are engaged, what offers are on the table, and when deadlines are coming. As a family, we're finally on the same page."_ — Maria, Parent, California

### Why This Feature Matters

Recruiting is traditionally an opaque process. Coaches email athletes (not parents). Athletes handle communications. Parents feel out of the loop. Families make decisions with incomplete information.

Parent collaboration changes this dynamic. It creates transparency, reduces stress, and improves decision-making. Parents can support without hovering. Athletes get guidance without losing independence.

## Feature 4: AI-Powered Suggestions

### Headline

**Let AI Guide Your Recruiting: Smart Suggestions for Your Next Move**

### One-Line Description

Get personalized AI recommendations for who to follow up with, which schools to add, and what to focus on next.

### Feature Overview (2-3 Sentences)

Recruiting generates endless "what-ifs": Should I follow up now or wait? Am I missing schools that fit my profile? What should I focus on this month? Recruiting Compass AI analyzes your profile, interactions, and the recruiting calendar to suggest smart next steps. It's like having a personal recruiting coach.

### Key Benefits

✅ **Smart Follow-Ups**: Know when to follow up with each coach (not too soon, not too late)
✅ **Find Hidden Schools**: Discover schools matching your profile you didn't consider
✅ **Stay on Schedule**: Get reminders for recruiting-appropriate activities at each phase
✅ **Reduce Analysis Paralysis**: Clear guidance on priorities instead of endless options
✅ **Personalized to You**: Suggestions adapt based on your profile, activity, and preferences

### Types of Suggestions

**Follow-Up Suggestions**

- "Follow up with Coach Smith (last contact 45 days ago)"
- Recommended timing: "Good time to reach out this week"
- Suggested angle: "Mention your recent performance improvement"

**School Suggestions**

- "Consider adding University of Texas—85% fit match"
- "These 3 D2 schools match your athletic profile"
- "Expand to JUCO options for better fit"

**Activity Suggestions**

- "Schedule campus visits at your top 3 schools this spring"
- "Attend 2+ summer showcases to get more exposure"
- "Update your highlight film (current one is from March)"

**Phase Suggestions**

- "You've completed most Sophomore tasks—ready to advance?"
- "Focus on campus visits during your Junior phase"
- "Time to narrow your list to top 10 schools"

### Real-World Example

**How AI Suggestions Helped Alex**

_Month 1 (Sophomore Phase):_

- AI suggests: "Send intro email to Coach Davis at Target School 1"
- Alex does it
- Coach responds

_Month 2:_

- AI suggests: "Follow up with Coach Davis (30 days since first contact)"
- Alex sends update on athletic performance
- Coach invites Alex to campus visit

_Month 3:_

- AI suggests: "Add these 2 D2 schools (92% fit) to your list"
- Alex researches them
- Decides to add 1 school

_Month 4:_

- AI suggests: "Schedule campus visits before Coach Smith gets busy (recruiting window ends May 31)"
- Alex schedules 3 visits
- All go great

**Result**: Alex stayed on track, didn't miss windows, and had multiple quality conversations with coaches. Without suggestions, Alex might have been passive or reactive.

### How AI Gets Smarter

The AI improves by learning:

- Your interaction patterns (which coaches you engage with most)
- Your preferences (which divisions/regions you're interested in)
- Your response to suggestions (which ones you act on)
- Your profile (as you update academic/athletic stats)
- Industry best practices (typical recruiting timelines and patterns)

The longer you use Recruiting Compass, the better suggestions become.

### Testimonial

> _"I had no idea I was supposed to follow up with coaches. The app told me Coach Johnson hadn't heard from me in 45 days and suggested I reach out. I did, and it turned into a full conversation. AI suggestions were like having a recruiting coach."_ — James, Student-Athlete, Class of 2025

### Why This Feature Matters

Recruiting is time-sensitive. Miss a recruiting window by a few weeks and a coach moves on to someone else. Get too aggressive and coaches think you're annoying.

AI suggestions solve this. They provide clear guidance on what to do next and when to do it—personalized to your profile and activity. It's like having a coach who knows your situation intimately and gives daily guidance.
