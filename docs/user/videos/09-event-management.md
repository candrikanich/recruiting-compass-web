## Script

### [0:00-0:20] Intro

[Camera: Direct engagement]

"A huge part of college recruiting happens at events—summer camps, showcases, tournaments, and official visits. Recruiting Compass lets you keep track of all these events and connect them to coach interactions so you know exactly what happened where."

[Screen: Show events section of app]

### [0:20-0:55] Creating an Event

[Screen: Click "Create Event" button, show event form]

"Creating an event is simple. You click 'Create Event' and fill in the basic info. What's the name of the event? What school or organization is hosting it? When is it? Where is it? What sport category? Is it a camp, showcase, or tournament?"

[Screen: Fill in event details]

"You can also add notes about the event, like which coaches you're expecting to see, what you want to work on, anything that's important for that event."

[Screen: Add notes, show event being created]

### [0:55-1:40] Logging Attendance & Interactions

[Screen: Show event created, navigate to during/after event]

"Now let's say the event happens. You attend. Coaches are there, they talk to you, maybe they watch you play. When you log an interaction during that event, you can tag it with the event. So later, when you're looking back, you can see—oh yeah, that conversation with Coach Johnson happened at the Elite Showcas."

[Screen: Show interaction creation with event selector dropdown]

"This keeps everything connected. Your event history, your coaching interactions, all in one place. You can see, over time, which events led to meaningful coaching contacts and which ones were less productive."

[Screen: Show interaction with event tag appearing in timeline]

### [1:40-2:00] Event Summary

[Camera: Direct to camera]

"Don't let these important events get lost in your memory. Create an event in Recruiting Compass, log your interactions during it, and you've got a complete record. Later, when you're trying to remember which coaches saw you play, or what happened at which event, you've got all the details right there. Keep it organized!"
