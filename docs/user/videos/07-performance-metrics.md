## Script

### [0:00-0:20] Intro

[Camera: Direct engagement]

"One of the things coaches care about is your athletic performance. Your stats, your trends, how you're improving over time. In Recruiting Compass, you can log your performance metrics so coaches can see your actual performance data."

[Screen: Show performance/stats section]

### [0:20-0:55] Adding Your Stats

[Screen: Navigate to performance metrics section, show input form]

"When you go to your performance section, you'll see fields for the stats that matter for your sport. If you're a pitcher, that might be ERA, strikeouts, velocity. If you're a hitter, it might be batting average, home runs, RBIs. If you're a fielder, maybe error rate, range, that sort of thing."

[Screen: Show sport-specific stat fields]

"You enter your stats for each season or each tournament. The system tracks it over time and builds a performance history. So you can see how you've improved from freshman to sophomore to junior year."

[Screen: Fill in sample stats, show them being saved]

### [0:55-1:40] Viewing Your Trends

[Screen: Show dashboard with performance chart/graph]

"Once you've logged some stats, you can see them in chart form. You can see your progression over time. Maybe your ERA has gone down, or your batting average has gone up. Visual trends are powerful because they tell a story about your development as an athlete."

[Screen: Display line chart showing stat improvement]

"You can also see how your stats compare to college benchmarks. For example, if you're a pitcher and your ERA is 2.5, you might see that the average ERA for D1 pitchers is 3.2. That context is useful when you're thinking about which schools are realistic for you."

"And here's the cool part—this performance data is visible to your parents if they're connected. So when they log in, they can see how you're doing athletically. It keeps everyone on the same page."

### [1:40-2:00] Why This Matters

[Camera: Direct to camera]

"Coaches want to see proof. Don't just tell them you're a good pitcher—show them your stats. Log your performance, let Recruiting Compass visualize your improvement, and you've got a powerful story to tell. Keep your stats current, and use them in your conversations with coaches."
