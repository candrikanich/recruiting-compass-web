## Script

### [0:00-0:20] Intro

[Camera: Direct engagement]

"One of the most powerful features in Recruiting Compass is the interaction log. This is where you keep track of every conversation, email, text message, or interaction you have with coaches. Trust me—after a few months, you're not going to remember who said what. This keeps everything organized in one place."

### [0:20-0:50] Creating an Interaction

[Screen: Click "Log Interaction" button]

"Let's say a coach from one of your target schools reaches out via email. You want to log that. Click 'Log Interaction', and you'll see a form."

[Screen: Show interaction form with fields]

"First, you select the school—which coach is this from? Then you pick the interaction type. Was it an email, a phone call, a text message, an in-person meeting? Let's say email."

[Screen: Fill in school, select email]

"Next, you can write notes about what the coach said, what you told them, any questions they asked. This is your space to capture the important details so you remember them later."

[Screen: Type detailed notes in text area]

"You can also set a date and time for when this happened. And then you're done! The interaction is logged and timestamped."

[Screen: Show interaction created and added to list]

### [0:50-1:45] Building Your Interaction History

[Screen: Show list of interactions from various coaches]

"As you log interactions, you're building a complete history. You can see every coach who's reached out, when they reached out, what they said. This is gold when you're trying to decide which schools are genuinely interested in you."

[Screen: Click on individual interaction to show expanded details]

"Click on an interaction to see more details. You can edit your notes, add attachments, set a follow-up reminder. Let me show you that."

[Screen: Show attachment upload, add file]

"Say you got an email from a coach with a questionnaire. You can attach that questionnaire right here so you don't lose it. Everything stays connected."

[Screen: Show file attached]

"You can also set a follow-up reminder. If a coach said, 'Hey, send me a video of your swing by next Friday,' you can set a reminder so you don't forget."

[Screen: Set reminder date]

### [1:45-2:40] Using Interaction Data

[Screen: Go back to interactions list, show dashboard]

"Here's what makes this really powerful. As you log interactions, Recruiting Compass is paying attention. It's tracking how responsive each coach is. Is this coach reaching out regularly, or have they gone silent? That responsiveness score helps you focus your effort on coaches who are genuinely interested."

[Screen: Show coach card with responsiveness score]

"It's also helping you stay organized. You can filter interactions by school, by coach, by type. You can see all your recent interactions, or search for something specific."

[Screen: Show filtering in action]

"And here's the really cool part—if a coach has gone silent for a while, Recruiting Compass will actually suggest next steps. Did we reach back out recently? Is there something else you should be doing? It's like having a coach in your corner."

[Screen: Show recovery plan/suggestion]

### [2:40-3:00] Wrap Up

[Camera: Direct to camera]

"Bottom line: log everything. When coaches reach out, when you reach out, when you meet at camps or showcases—get it in the system. This is your recruiting lifeline. It keeps you organized, it helps you remember important details, and it gives you insights into who's really interested. Make it a habit!"
