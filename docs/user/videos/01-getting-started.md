"Hey! Welcome to Recruiting Compass. If you're a student-athlete navigating college recruiting, or a parent helping guide that process, you've found the right place. In this video, I'm going to walk you through the basics—how to get set up in about five minutes, and how to add your first school. Let's jump in!"

### [0:20-0:45] Sign Up

[Screen: Navigate to sign up page]

"First things first—you'll want to create an account. Click that 'Sign Up' button up there, and you'll see a simple form. Just enter your email address and create a password. That's it! No credit card required, and we're totally free to use."

[Screen: Fill in email field, password field, click create account]

"Once you've signed up, you'll get a confirmation email. Just click the link in there, and boom—you're in!"

[Screen: Show confirmation message]

### [0:45-1:20] Your Profile

[Screen: Land on dashboard, show profile section]

"Now that you're in, let's set up your profile. This is where you'll tell Recruiting Compass about you—your name, your sport, your position, your graduation year, that kind of stuff. This is super important because it helps us understand your recruiting timeline and calculate fit scores for schools."

[Screen: Click on profile/settings]

"Here's the profile page. You'll see fields for basic info—first name, last name, graduation year. And then some athletic info—position, stats, your GPA, test scores if you've got them. The more information you fill in here, the better suggestions we can give you."

[Screen: Fill in a few key fields to show how it works]

"You don't need to fill everything out right now. You can come back and add more details later. But let's at least get the basics down so we can help you effectively."

[Screen: Show saved confirmation]

### [1:20-2:30] Adding Your First School

[Screen: Show dashboard with "Add School" button or navigate to schools section]

"Alright, next up—adding your first school. This is where it gets fun. Click 'Add School' and search for a college. Let's say we're looking at Duke. You can search by name, and we'll pull up the school information automatically."

[Screen: Click "Add School", search bar appears, type "Duke"]

"Cool! Here's Duke showing up in our search. Click on it to add it to your list. Notice that Recruiting Compass automatically pulls in some information—like the location, division, coaching info. All that stuff is already there."

[Screen: Click on Duke, see school details card]

"Now you've got a few options. You can set the tier—that's whether this is a reach, target, or safety school for you. Let's say Duke is a reach for you. You can also add some notes if you want. And that's it! The school is now on your list."

[Screen: Show school added to list with tier applied]

"Over time, you'll come back and add more schools—maybe 15 or 20 total, across different tiers. This gives you a nice organized list to work with as coaches start reaching out."

### [2:30-2:55] What's Next

[Screen: Show dashboard overview with the one school added]

"So that's the basics! You've got an account, you've filled in your profile, and you've added your first school. From here, you can start logging interactions with coaches, checking your fit scores for each school, and following a timeline that takes you through all four years of recruiting."

[Screen: Briefly show timeline, interactions, fit score features]

"In the next videos, we'll dive deeper into each of these features. But for now, congratulations—you're officially set up! Let's get recruiting. See you in the next one!"

## Screen Directions & Notes

- **Login/Sign up page**: Calm, clean UI. Emphasize simplicity.
- **Dashboard**: Show empty state with welcoming message.
- **Profile form**: Use demo data (e.g., "Alex Johnson", pitcher, class of 2027, 3.8 GPA).
- **School search**: Use Duke as example (recognizable, fits the demo tier system).
- **School details**: Show automatic fields populated (location, division, coach info).
- **Final dashboard**: Show one school in list with tier badge.

## Tone Notes

- **Energy level**: Friendly, encouraging, not too fast.
- **Pacing**: Slow enough to follow, especially during form filling.
- **Camera**: Direct engagement—smile, make eye contact.
- **Pauses**: Natural pauses after key actions (form submission, school added).

## Recording Tips

- Record screen + webcam (webcam in corner).
- Zoom in on forms if text is small.
- Use cursor highlights to draw attention to clickable elements.
- Pause for 1-2 seconds after each action to let viewers absorb.
