Parents can view your schools, coaches, interactions, and timeline, but cannot edit your data.

### What information should I put in my profile?

As much as you're comfortable sharing:

- **Academic**: GPA, test scores, preferred major
- **Athletic**: Position, height, weight, your best stats (speed, exit velo, etc.)
- **Preferences**: College divisions you prefer, geographic regions, school size

The more complete your profile, the better our fit scores and AI suggestions will be.

- You get new test scores
- Your athletic stats improve (faster, stronger, better times)
- Your recruiting preferences change

Quarterly reviews recommended.

### What happens if I delete my account?

All your data is permanently deleted. You cannot undo this action. Contact support@recruitingcompass.com if you need help.

## Schools & Finding Fit

### How many schools should I track?

Most athletes track 10-20 schools across all tiers:

- **Reach Schools**: 2-3 (dream schools, competitive, less likely)
- **Target Schools**: 4-6 (realistic matches, good fit)
- **Safety Schools**: 2-3 (likely accepts, strong fit)

Start with 10-15 and adjust as you narrow your list or expand your search.

### I can't find my school in the database. What should I do?

Try different variations of the name:

- Full name: "University of Texas"
- Nickname: "Texas" or "UT"
- Include state: "Florida State"

If you still can't find it, email support@recruitingcompass.com with the school name and we'll add it.

### What does my fit score mean?

**Fit Score (1-10 scale):**

- **9-10**: Perfect fit (strong academic/athletic match, location preference, etc.)
- **7-8**: Good fit (strong match in most areas)
- **5-6**: Moderate fit (good in some areas, not others)
- **3-4**: Low fit (few areas align)
- **1-2**: Poor fit (minimal alignment)

Fit scores are based on your academic/athletic stats, location preferences, and school standards. They improve as you update your profile.

### My fit score seems too low. How do I improve it?

Fit scores depend on:

- Your profile completeness (all academic/athletic fields filled in)
- Accuracy of your info (make sure your GPA/stats are correct)
- School's standards (some schools have higher academic requirements)

To improve your fit score:

1. Complete all profile fields
2. Update your athletic stats (record improvements)
3. Make sure academic info is accurate

### Can I ignore my fit score if I really like a school?

Absolutely. Fit scores are a tool, not a rule. If you're genuinely interested in a school with a lower fit score, pursue it. Trust your instincts.

### How do I know if a school is a good fit?

Beyond fit scores, consider:

- **Coaching Philosophy**: Do they develop players like you?
- **Program Fit**: Winning tradition? Feeding professional prospects?
- **Campus Life**: Does the school culture match yours?
- **Academic Programs**: Does your major align with their offerings?
- **Location**: Will you be happy in this city/region?
- **Financial Fit**: Can you afford it (with or without scholarship)?

Fit scores are a starting point. Use other research to validate your interest.

## Coaches & Communication

### How do I find coaches at a specific school?

1. Go to Schools
2. Click on the school
3. Scroll down to see "Coaches at This School"
4. Click "Add Coach" to add coaches if they're missing

Most schools' coaching staffs are available online on their athletic department websites.

### What's the best way to contact a coach?

**Email is safest** (unless they give you their personal phone):

1. Keep it professional and brief (3-5 sentences)
2. Introduce yourself specifically (name, position, school)
3. Explain why you're interested in their program
4. Include your stats or link to highlight film
5. Sign off professionally

Example:

```
Hi Coach Smith,

My name is John Doe, and I'm a shortstop from Lincoln High School. I'm very interested in your program and would love to learn more. I've attached my highlight film and stats.

Thanks for your time!

Best,
John Doe
```

### How many times should I email a coach?

- **Initial email**: Once
- **Follow-up** (if no response): After 2-3 weeks, send one follow-up
- **Subsequent outreach**: 1-2 emails per month unless they initiate more

Don't spam coaches with multiple emails. Quality over quantity.

### What if a coach doesn't respond?

- **Normal**: Coaches are busy. Some take weeks or months to respond.
- **First step**: Wait 2-3 weeks, then send a brief follow-up email.
- **If still silent** (30+ days): The AI will suggest a recovery plan—a strategic way to re-engage.
- **Consider**: Not all coaches are actively recruiting. Some respond minimally.

### Is it okay to text a coach?

Only if:

- They give you their personal phone number
- They've already responded to emails

Keep texts brief and professional. Avoid texting late at night or too early in the morning.

### What should I do after attending a showcase where coaches saw me?

1. **Identify which coaches were there** (many showcases list coaches attending)
2. **Send thank you emails** within 24 hours
3. **Mention specifics**: "Thanks for watching me play shortstop on Saturday"
4. **Log a "Showcase" interaction** in Recruiting Compass
5. **Update your fit score** for that school if you have new info

### How do I share my stats or highlight film with coaches?

1. Go to Performance or Documents
2. Click "Share"
3. Copy the shareable link
4. Email the link to the coach

Links are private—only people with the link can access your info.

### The coach contact information seems wrong. How do I fix it?

1. Click on the coach
2. Click the pencil/edit icon
3. Update the contact info
4. Click "Save"

Most coaching staffs change annually, so contact info may be outdated. Update it if you find better info.

## Timeline & Phases

### What are the timeline phases?

| Phase         | Grade | Focus                                   |
| ------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Freshman**  | 9th   | Build skills, get on coaches' radars    |
| **Sophomore** | 10th  | Active outreach, showcases, tournaments |
| **Junior**    | 11th  | Peak recruiting, campus visits, offers  |
| **Senior**    | 12th  | Narrow choices, finalize commitment     |

### What's the difference between each phase?

**Freshman Phase:**

- Build athletic and academic foundation
- Start attending showcases
- Get on coaches' early radar

**Sophomore Phase:**

- Attend more showcases and tournaments
- Send intro emails to coaches
- Build relationships gradually

**Junior Phase:**

- Peak recruiting activity
- Campus visits and official visits (D1/D2)
- Offers start coming in

**Senior Phase:**

- Narrow down to top 3-5 choices
- Official visits to finalists
- Make commitment decision

### When should I advance to the next phase?

You can advance anytime, but phases are designed to align with high school grades:

- Freshman year → Sophomore phase (in spring)
- Sophomore year → Junior phase (in spring)
- Junior year → Senior phase (in fall)

You can advance early or delay advancement based on your recruiting schedule.

### What if I'm behind on timeline tasks?

Timeline tasks are guides, not rules. If you're behind:

1. Catch up at your own pace (no penalties)
2. Focus on the most important tasks first
3. Skip tasks that don't apply to you
4. Customize your timeline as needed

### Can I go back to a previous phase?

Yes. Click on a phase in your timeline and choose to go back. All previous tasks and progress remain.

## Interactions & Logging

### How do I log an interaction with a coach?

1. Click on the coach
2. Click "Log Interaction"
3. Select the type (email, phone, text, in-person, showcase, etc.)
4. Enter the date it happened (defaults to today)
5. Add notes about what was discussed
6. Click "Log Interaction"

### Can I log interactions that happened in the past?

Yes. When logging an interaction, click the date field and select a date in the past. This is useful if you're catching up on past communications.

### What details should I include in my interaction notes?

Keep notes brief but specific:

- ✅ "Introduced myself via email with highlight video link"
- ✅ "Coach called to ask about my academics and athletic background"
- ✅ "Met Coach Smith at showcase, discussed my fit for program"

Don't include:

- ❌ Entire email text (summarize instead)
- ❌ Personal drama or negativity
- ❌ Information shared in confidence

### What if I accidentally logged the wrong interaction?

1. Click on the interaction in the timeline
2. Click the pencil icon to edit or trash icon to delete
3. Make your change

### I deleted an interaction by mistake. Can I get it back?

Unfortunately, once deleted, interactions cannot be recovered. Create a new interaction entry with the correct information.

### How often should I log interactions?

Log interactions within 24 hours while details are fresh. At minimum, log them before you forget the details.

### What's the difference between "Email (you sent)" and "Coach Email"?

- **Email (you sent)**: You initiated the contact
- **Coach Email**: Coach reached out to you

This distinction helps you track who's driving the conversation.

## Fit Scores & AI

### How are fit scores calculated?

Fit scores consider:

1. **Academic Fit** (30%): Your GPA/test scores vs. school's standards
2. **Athletic Fit** (30%): Your stats vs. team roster
3. **Location Fit** (15%): Distance from home, your preferences
4. **Program Fit** (15%): Team reputation, coaching philosophy
5. **Financial Fit** (10%): Scholarship availability, your needs

### How accurate are fit scores?

Fit scores are as accurate as your profile. More complete profile = more accurate scores.

Consider fit scores a starting point, not absolute truth. Trust your gut about schools you're interested in.

### What should I do with my fit score?

**Use it to:**

- Identify schools you might not have considered
- Understand why a school is a good/bad match
- Compare schools objectively
- Get suggestions for improvement

**Don't use it to:**

- Eliminate schools you're genuinely interested in
- Make final decisions (use it as one factor among many)
- Rush your decision

### My profile is complete but my fit score is still low. Why?

Possible reasons:

- **Academic mismatch**: Your GPA is below the school's typical student
- **Athletic mismatch**: Your stats don't align with the team's recruitment focus
- **Location mismatch**: School is far from your stated preferences
- **School mismatch**: The school has different academic/athletic standards

A lower fit score doesn't mean the school is bad—just that it may be more competitive or different from your profile.

### How do AI suggestions work?

AI suggests actions based on:

- Your profile and preferences
- Your interaction patterns with coaches
- Industry-standard recruiting timelines
- What successful athletes do

Suggestions improve over time as the AI learns from your behavior.

### What if the AI suggestions aren't helpful?

1. Make sure your profile is complete and accurate
2. Check your stated preferences (division level, geographic area)
3. Give the AI time to learn (first 1-2 weeks of activity)
4. Disable notifications if suggestions feel like noise (Settings > Notifications)

### Can I ignore AI suggestions?

Absolutely. Suggestions are guidance, not requirements. Follow the ones that make sense for you, ignore the rest.

## Recruiting Process Questions

### What's an official visit?

An **official visit** is when a school pays for your travel, housing, and meals to visit campus. Features:

- Only available for D1/D2 prospects (rarely D3)
- Usually happens junior or senior year
- Coaches coordinate all details
- Limited number allowed per school
- Very valuable for evaluation and getting to know the program

### What's an unofficial visit?

An **unofficial visit** is when you visit campus on your own dime. Features:

- Anytime, any year
- You pay for travel and housing
- Coaches can meet with you (restrictions vary by division)
- More relaxed, informal visits
- Good for getting a feel for campus before official visit

### What's a recruiting survey?

A questionnaire coaches send asking about:

- Your academic info
- Your athletic background
- Your goals and interests
- Your fit with their program

Complete them thoroughly and return promptly. Coaches use responses to evaluate you.

### When should I start looking at colleges?

Many athletes start:

- **Freshman year**: Research and attend showcases
- **Sophomore year**: More active outreach to coaches
- **Junior year**: Peak recruiting activity
- **Senior year**: Make final decision

**It's never too late** to start, even as a junior or senior.

### When should I commit to a school?

Timing is personal, but generally:

- **Freshman/Sophomore**: Too early for most
- **Junior year**: Some committed athletes (especially if they love the school)
- **Senior year (Fall/Early Winter)**: Most athletes commit by fall
- **Signing Day**: National Signing Day (February for baseball)

There's no "best time"—commit when you're confident in your choice.

### What if I'm not getting recruited?

Possible reasons and solutions:

1. **It's early** (freshman/sophomore year is normal to have little contact)
   - Solution: Attend showcases, improve stats, be patient
2. **Coaches don't know about you yet**
   - Solution: Be proactive—email coaches, attend showcases
3. **Your stats don't match schools' needs**
   - Solution: Keep improving, be realistic about your level
4. **You haven't attended showcases**
   - Solution: Sign up for baseball showcases in your area
5. **Your film is poor quality**
   - Solution: Work with a videographer on better highlights

### What do colleges look for?

Colleges evaluate:

- **Academic Performance**: GPA, test scores, transcript
- **Athletic Ability**: Stats, measurables (speed, exit velo), position
- **Effort & Athleticism**: How hard you work, improvement trajectory
- **Character**: Coachability, work ethic, maturity
- **Fit**: Does your profile match their program needs?

### How do I know if I'm good enough for a specific division level?

Use:

1. **Fit Scores**: See if you match academically/athletically
2. **Coach Response**: Are coaches at that level recruiting you?
3. **Comparable Athletes**: Research where similar athletes went
4. **Showcase Performance**: How do you compare to other players there?

Start with a balanced list (reach, target, safety) and adjust based on feedback.

### What's the difference between signing and committing?

- **Commit**: Verbal agreement to attend a school (can be non-binding)
- **Sign**: Official signing of Letter of Intent (LOI) or National Letter of Intent (NLI)—binding agreement

Signing usually happens at the end of senior year or before summer college season.
